A blanket is drooped over your shoulders as you watch the mass of skyscrapers lay against the night's sky. Sipping a glass of red from the enclaves of your cozy apartment, the vista is obstructed by the memory of a conversation earlier today with a coworker, evangelizing the cliche that money does not buy happiness. I had suspicion that he was suggesting that I had fallen victim to this fate. What an absurdity! Humans are rational beings capable of rational decisions, and it takes no longer than a moment's thought for you to know you're happier now than before. Perhaps there was a tinge of jealousy from him.

Their is a cacophony of cognitive biases, degrading one's ability to act rationally. Although it might be tempting to think of oneself as a purely rationale being, we are all victim to these biases in some form throughout our lives. Despite not being immune to biases, there are mechanisms we can use to minimize them as we will soon find out.

Our character is being accused of running on the [Hednoic Treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill). After a significant purchase, individuals will often experience increased happiness, only for this increased happiness to regress to the mean over time. The net result is the individual's happiness is no greater after the purchase than it was before the purchase, they have adapted to their change in circumstances.

However this is more difficult to spot this than one might ostensibly believe due to the [Peak-end rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule). When we look back at how we felt over a given period of time, we often evaluate our experience based on the most intensive moment, the peak or the trough, rather than how we felt based on the average of all experiences of that time.

For example you might judge your time in your new apartment as great due to the elation you felt when you first moved in (the peak), despite your average mood being quite unremarkable. Thus you have incorrectly concluded that a stimuli (a new apartment) has caused a consistent increase in your well being, when in actuality it only caused a single spike, and otherwise had a trivial effect. It's worth noting that in this specific example, you might believe you have become happier as you have done what's expected of you i.e. [keeping up with the Joneses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses).

[Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow) by Daniel Kahneman further details the numerous biases we have, and how this affects our decision making. Kahneman states that being conscious of our biases allows us to mitigate them and make more rational decisions. This is certainly true, by identifying we are making a decision not based on rationality but on a cognitive bias, we can avoid making irrational decisions. However this does fall short in some circumstances.

If you have the decision between X and Y, and you identify that you *might* be biased towards choosing X, how do you proceed? Do you deduct some arbitrary worth from X to compensate for your bias? How on earth could you calculate _how_ much to deduct, if any? Just because you are susceptible to a bias does not mean it actually affected the decision, which leads to the questions, how do you determine if a given bias affected the decision?

One rational approach is to ask an unbiased third party for advice. This will work well for a subset of scenarios, but for others such as if this apartment has made me happier, this is not applicable. My happiness from my new apartment might be hedonic adaptation, or maybe I actually am happier because of the greater quality of life due to the new apartment, I don't know!

One approach to solve this is to measure perceived happiness. Performing this ritual each day mitigates bias stemming from the Peak-end rule. By measuring the average perceived happiness over the course of being in the apartment, we can measure just how much the apartment has affected perceived happiness. This approach isnâ€™t to be wholly relied on when making decisions, but rather to augment the decision making process. Yes analyzing happiness does come with its own set of biases and is by no means a panacea, but the goal here is not to remove bias, but to mitigate.

But how do we measure happiness? Fortunately there is prior art on this problem of measuring happiness. One approach is to use a 4-item subjective happiness article ([Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999](https://www.notion.so/Lyubomirsky-Lepper-1999-c93bc48262e94fd7ae50771e8125e275)). This is a common approach among researchers (cited >4000 times). The methodology is as follows:

1. In general, I consider myself:
```
not a very happy person 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 a very happy person
```
2. Compared to most of my peers, I consider myself:
```
less happy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 more happy
```

3. Some people are generally very happy. They enjoy life regardless of what is going on,
getting the most out of everything. To what extent does this characterization describe you?
```
not at all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 a great deal
```

4. Some people are generally not very happy. Although they are not depressed, they never
seem as happy as they might be. To what extend does this characterization describe you?
```
not at all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 a great deal
```

This allows us to make correlations between happiness and life events. We can measure if our recorded happiness before moving into the newer apartment is different to happiness several months after moving in. We can determine if times were better before you were in your current relationship. We can determine what life events are causing genuine changes in our wellbeing.

It might not be so difficult to remember a terrible day several months ago where there was a bad fight with your partner, but it is difficult to remember if the cause was a more mundane event such as a hangover, or a disagreement with your manager. By consistently recording events such as sleep, alcohol consumption, if you spent time with friends, if you exercised.

This might appear to be a waste of time, clearly being underslept will decrease your mood? The rationale is twofold.

Firstly, as mentioned above, the Peak-end rule explains how we overweight the most intensive experiences, and underweight the average experience. Recording our perceived happiness aims to mitigate this bias. More concretely, it might help illustrate that despite the fight with your partner (overwighted peak), you are on average much happier when you spend time with them. Despite the scales not moving much, you feel much better on days where you exercise compared to days when you don't (underweighted average). 

Secondly, through looking at the data you might notice correlations that you would have otherwise not noticed. Perhaps it shows a correlation between a poor night's sleep and decreased wellbeing for multiple subsequent days, not just the day after. [Mike Bechtel in this post](https://mikebechtel.medium.com/i-tracked-every-single-thing-i-ate-for-a-full-year-here-are-10-quick-a-has-2c259dd2f57b) records his sugar consumption, and correlated it with poorer sleep and subsequently a worse mood the next day.

The overarching goal is to try and see through biases, and realize what actually causes increases and decreases our happiness, allowing us to correct ourselves, and live happier lives.

So maybe put down that glass of red, and go for a run.
